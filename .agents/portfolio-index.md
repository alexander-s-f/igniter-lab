## Canon Boundary Rules (igniter-lang)

| Rule | Statement | Adopted |
|------|-----------|---------|
| CR-001 | Canon type opacity: IO.* types are opaque identifiers; schema is lab-only | 2026-06-07 |
| CR-002 | Lab diagnostic boundary: E-NET-* codes are lab-local; OOF promotion requires PROP+grammar review | 2026-06-07 |
| CR-003 | Profile binding is intent record only — not validated authority until PROP-040 OOF-M7/M8 active | 2026-06-07 (closed by PROP-040) |

**Boundary:** Canon grammar names IO types as opaque identifiers (CR-001). Schema, delegation
algebra, FFI, E-NET-* codes remain lab-only. Runtime injection is Phase 2.
HTTP-client boundary (P6/HTTP): typed HttpRequest/Response records + capability policy + mocked transport
+ telemetry redaction proved (48/48). Real network I/O, DNS, TLS, and accept-loop startup remain closed.
Map alignment (P7): Map[String,String] headers proved for both record shapes; map_get/or_else typechain
clean; redaction preserves Map shape; policy is header-agnostic; 55/55 PASS.
PROP-043-P5 production Map with Record/Map bridge landed 2026-06-09 (55/55); P7 uses same proof-local architecture.
Error result + retry envelope (P8): HttpResult typed envelope (ok/denied/error discriminant); RetryPolicy
5xx→retry/4xx→no retry/denial→no retry; RetrySimulatorP8 BudgetedLocalLoop analog (no scheduler/clock);
capability denial as typed data through full envelope; 50/50 PASS.
Upstream call contract composition (P9): ContractResult typed domain envelope (found/created/not_found/
upstream_error/capability_denied/upstream_unavailable); Rack single-call + Sidekiq retry scenarios;
DomainResponseMapper shields domain code from transport internals; call_contract proof-local; 55/55 PASS.

### IO.FileCapability / File-Text IO

| Artifact | Repo | Status | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| LAB-FILE-IO-P1 (File/Text capability shape and mocked read snapshot proof — File IO distinguished from Storage IO: root/path/encoding/size/symlink/traversal authority, not table/source/query-plan authority; `FileCapability` + `FileReadRequest` + explicit `MockFileRegistry` fixture data -> `FileReadResult` + `FileReadReceipt`; gates G1 root/G2 op+read/G3 traversal/G4 symlink/G5 not_found/G6 size/G7 encoding/G8 content; result kinds content/not_found/denied/file_error/decode_error/size_error; `denied` separated from not_found/size_error/decode_error; no unknown_external_state or partial_success in single-file mocked read; receipt mirrors result_kind+bytes_read and remains evidence only; no ambient cwd, directory listing, symlink following, real filesystem reads/writes, public API, or canon schema authority) | igniter-lab | ✅ DONE — proof complete | 78/78 |

**Boundary:** Canon still treats `IO.FileCapability` as an opaque name only. LAB-FILE-IO-P1 proves a family-specific mocked read boundary, not a real filesystem adapter. `MockFileRegistry` is explicit fixture data; `FileReadReceipt` is evidence, not authority. Next File route: LAB-FILE-IO-P2 mocked write attempt / atomicity boundary, or parallel LAB-CLOCK-P1 / LAB-HOST-IPC-P1. Real filesystem reads/writes remain HOLD.

### Profile System (PROP-033 / PROP-040)

| Artifact | Repo | Status | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| PROP-033: `via <profile>` binding on contract declarations | igniter-lang | ✅ experiment-pass | 52/52 |

| OOF-M7 (modifier below profile authority) / OOF-M8 (unknown profile) | igniter-lang | ✅ active in classifier | — |
| CR-003 closed by PROP-040 | igniter-lang | ✅ | — |

**Profile chain:** `profile_binding` (PROP-033) + `profile_authority` (PROP-040) propagate through
all four pipeline stages (parser → classifier → typechecker → SemanticIR). Via references
to undeclared profiles now trigger OOF-M8 at classify time.

### Contract Modifiers (PROP-031 / PROP-035)

| Artifact | Repo | Status |

| LAB-STR-UNICODE-P3 handler hygiene + receipt | igniter-lab | ✅ closed 2026-06-08 — bare `split` guard aligned (P3 hygiene, no bypass via legacy name); unicode_runtime_receipt.json emitted (lab-only-evidence); 41/41 PASS |

**Formula:** `Text` is canonical contract type for text values. `String` literal compat via v0 rule only.
`stdlib.text.*` is experiment-pass compiler surface. Runtime Unicode/value semantics proven in lab VM.
Handler-policy consistency proven (bare and qualified split/replace both fail-closed on empty input).
Stable public API and runtime-execution gate remain closed.

**v0 surface (14 ops):** `concat`, `trim`, `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `split`, `replace`, `replace_all`,
`byte_length`, `rune_length`, `grapheme_length`, `byte_slice`, `rune_slice`, `grapheme_slice`

**SemanticIR:** `kind: "call"`, `fn: "stdlib.text.*"`; no new IR kind needed (consistent with `stdlib.integer.*`)

**Closed:** runtime execution, bounds policy, locale case folding, regex, tokenizer,
TextEngine, streaming text, method syntax forms, stable public stdlib.text API.

**Alignment gap:** LAB-SIDEKIQ-P1..P5 + RECORD-VM-P1..P3 + RECORD-MAP-P1 + LAB-VM-MAP-P1 → lang | JobReceipt record typed and VM-executed (P1/P2); nested record field values proved (P3); Map[String,String] meta field bridge proved (RECORD-MAP-P1). PROP-043-P5 closed: map_get/or_else production TypeChecker live (55/55); C1 fix landed. LAB-SIDEKIQ-P5 closed: full upstream composition — all 4 job paths (success/denied/retry/exhausted) proved with Map[String,String] metadata; BudgetedLocalLoop simulation (48/48). LAB-VM-MAP-P1 closed: MetadataReader VM gap closed; map_get(job.metadata,"queue") executes end-to-end in VM (48/48 PASS). Still open: three-level chained field access, enum/status type system, async retry, queue storage, effect-callee dispatch.

**Boundary:** Job processing vocabulary is lab-only. No Sidekiq compatibility claim. No StorageCapability, ServiceLoop, or scheduler surfaces open. `call_contract` is lab-only with no stable API.

### Concurrency / Scheduling (Lab only)

**Boundary:** Lab-only. `ReplayableReceipt`, `PolicySchedulingReceipt`, and `SchedulingReceipt` are telemetry evidence only — they do not create semantic authority over scheduling decisions and do not open runtime concurrency authority. No `Thread`/`Fiber`/async-runtime infrastructure used. Concurrent-effectful dispatch requires explicit `SchedulingPolicy` (P2); overlapping writes and unknown resource keys always fail-closed; capability denial is Gate 1. Parity invariant proved across all fixtures: `result_values` identical regardless of `concurrent_eligible` flag (P1+P2). Replay invariant proved (P3): tampered receipts fail closed across all drift categories; consistent result tampering caught by Gate 10 re-execution; legal intra-wave permutations are structurally equivalent. Minimal substrate contract named (P4): five-phase model + 9 invariants + substrate options matrix + failure-mode matrix; real threading HOLD until P5 thread-safety proof; async HOLD until separate authorization card.

**Boundary:** QueryPlan v1 = nested typed records (QuerySource/Projection/FilterPredicate/OrderBy) + Collection[FilterPredicate] + Map[String,String] metadata; all pure CORE contracts; no grammar changes; no SQL; no DB connections. ORM/ActiveRecord permanently incompatible. `IO.StorageCapability` schema designed (follows PROP-035 model; grammar impl requires PROP-035). QueryResult follows KDR convention (PROP-044-P1). ExecuteQuery = ESCAPE → STORAGE (Stage 2+). LAB-STORAGE-CAPABILITY-P1 design-locked. Rust typechecker array_literal gap: **CLOSED by LAB-TC-ARRAY-P1 (27/27 PASS)** — array literals now type as Collection[T] in declared Collection output contexts (contextual); inline filter construction compiles + VM round-trips; the P3 `filters`-as-input workaround is no longer required. **Record-field-position follow-up CLOSED by LAB-TC-ARRAY-P2 (19/19 PASS):** an intermediate array-literal compute feeding a typed record field (e.g. QueryPlan.filters) now types as Collection[T] via a local single-hop Ref-field hint prescan (no global inference); remaining edges (inline-in-field literals, multi-hop, conflicting hints) deferred to an optional v1 collection-inference card, not required before execution. With P1+P2, filter collections are fully constructible inline — expressivity is sufficient for LAB-EXECUTE-QUERY-P1. **LAB-STORAGE-CAPABILITY-P2 CLOSED (51/51 PASS):** 6-gate denial sequence proved; G4=clamp (not denial); G5→query_error (not denied); QueryExecutionReceipt 15-field invariants; denial-as-data 9th proof (StorageCapability 5th domain); ESCAPE class enforcement confirmed (effect contract passport gap = correct behavior); Rust effect name vocabulary closed ({read_file,read_json,read,write_file,write_json,write}); two-fixture architecture established for effect+pure contract lab separation. **LAB-EXECUTE-QUERY-P1 CLOSED (57/57 PASS):** first executable Stage 2+ query path proved;

extended check_record_literal_shape with type_shapes param + RecordLiteral arm for recursive contextual validation of inline nested record literals; bounded: one call per nesting level, no global inference, no Hindley-Milner, no retroactive mutation; natural projection syntax now compiles: compute plan = { ..., projection: { fields: "...", include_all: false }, ... }; two-level nesting (ContactRecord → Contact → Address) works; fail-closed: missing field/extra field/wrong-type field in nested literal → OOF-TY0 with informative messages; LAB-TC-ARRAY-P1/P2 unaffected; PROJECTION-P1 workaround (projection as input) still valid; Ruby TC B9 divergence documented (different bug in Ruby TC, not fixed here); fix scope: typechecker.rs only, no VM/parser/grammar/production-runtime change. **LAB-EXECUTE-QUERY-P3 CLOSED (68/68 PASS):** unified mocked query execution receipt proved;

effective_limit recorded in receipt); G5 include_all policy→query_error (NOT denied; fires before filter/order/limit/projection); query_error≠denied invariant confirmed throughout (G1/G2/G3→denied; all other failures→query_error); receipt mirrors result_kind and rows_returned after full pipeline (after projection; cap_granted:false iff denied/query_error); G1/G2/G3 short-circuit: filter/order/limit/projection NOT evaluated on denial;

**Boundary (LAB-STORAGE-ADAPTER-P1):** mocked adapter contract only; Query v0 semantics reused, not redefined; `StorageAdapterReceipt` is adapter evidence, not authority; allowed source missing from mock registry is `system_error` (fixture/substrate missing), never `empty`; no real DB/SQL/ORM/writes/joins/aggregates/optimizer/public API/parser/compiler/VM/canon authority. Next storage route: LAB-STORAGE-ADAPTER-P2 receipt/replay hardening, or parallel LAB-FILE-IO-P1 / LAB-HOST-IPC-P1; real storage adapter remains HOLD.

**Boundary (LAB-STORAGE-ADAPTER-P2):** replay verifier is evidence checker only; it requires original request + source fixture and never re-authorizes execution from receipts. `QueryExecutionReceipt` and `StorageAdapterReceipt` remain evidence, not capability. Tamper returns `tampered`; fixture/capability/plan/version changes return drift/version KDRs; receipt-only replay returns `insufficient_evidence`. Next storage route: LAB-STORAGE-ADAPTER-P3 adapter versioning / schema evolution, or parallel LAB-FILE-IO-P1 / LAB-HOST-IPC-P1; real storage adapter remains HOLD.

26. ✅ LAB-COMPILER-LIVENESS-P3: calibrated E-COMPILER-BUDGET hard limits (2026-06-08)
    Fatal budget: tc.infer_expr limit=1000, fr.walk_expr limit=1000 (5× P2 adversarial max of 200)
    Observe-only: emitter/parser counters (insufficient calibration data — P2 measured 0)
    Budget breach → status="compiler_error" + E-COMPILER-BUDGET (is_compiler_internal=true, is_source_program_fault=false)
    1100-term breach fixture confirms fail-closed at depth 1001 > limit 1000
    200-term P2 probe still accepted (depth 200 < 1000) — no regression
    Canonical fixtures: ok, breaches=[]; OOF fixtures: still oof; stdout always valid JSON
    verify_liveness_p3.rb: 38/38 PASS; verify_liveness_p2.rb: 25/25 PASS (backward compat)
    E-COMPILER-BUDGET lab-local per CR-002; no canon OOF codes; no grammar/VM/lang changes
    Next: LAB-COMPILER-LIVENESS-P4 (calibrate emitter/parser observe-only; E-COMPILER-CYCLE candidate)
27. ✅ LAB-COMPILER-LIVENESS-P4: emitter/parser calibration + E-COMPILER-CYCLE preflight (2026-06-08)
    em_lower: calibrated to 30 (30-term form expression); mirrors tc_infer; P3 budget implicitly bounds it
    em_pipeline: calibrated to 10 (9 nested filters in if_expr); bounded by source nesting depth
    parse_import: STRUCTURAL BOUND — lexer merges uppercase-dotted paths to single Ident token;
      counter always 0 (no imports) or 1 (any import); cannot exceed 1 without lexer change
    E-COMPILER-CYCLE: risk classified LOW for all passes (finite AST, no form-calls-form, no back-edges)
    compiler_error sidecar: stdout-only is correct (unreliable record worse than no record)
    All three counters confirmed observe-only (data-justified, not assumption-based)
    New fixtures: liveness_emitter_form_lower.ig, liveness_emitter_pipeline_depth.ig, liveness_parser_import_steps.ig
    verify_liveness_p4.rb: 40/40 PASS; verify_liveness_p3.rb: 38/38 PASS; verify_liveness_p2.rb: 25/25 PASS
    Next: LAB-COMPILER-LIVENESS-P5 if: form-calls-form grammar change, production corpus data, or E-COMPILER-BUDGET PROP
28. ✅ LAB-COMPILER-LIVENESS-P5: parser non-progress and subprocess timeout hardening (2026-06-09)
    Root cause: peek_type returned false for Eof when current()=None (past EOF sentinel); all while!peek_type(Eof) loops hung
    Fix 1 (parser.rs): peek_type returns true for Eof when current()=None — single-function, zero semantic change
    Fix 2 (parser.rs): parse_body_decl_with_recovery wraps output/compute — on Err: advance, emit OOF-P1, skip to boundary
    Fix 3 (parser.rs): parse_type_decl field loop — explicit match-on-Err for name/colon/type; OOF-P1 per bad field
    BoundedCommand (verify_liveness_p5.rb): Process.spawn + killer thread (SIGTERM then SIGKILL); 15s default timeout
    Process invariant: pgrep count unchanged before/after 5 malformed compiles (P5-I)
    stdout bounded: all malformed inputs < 1KB, well-formed < 64KB cap; all valid JSON (P5-J)
    New fixtures: 5 malformed hang fixtures + 1 well-formed regression guard
    verify_liveness_p5.rb: 46/46 PASS; verify_liveness_p4.rb: 40/40 PASS (backward compat)
    No new OOF codes, no language semantics change, no canon impact, no runtime/VM change
    Next: extend parse_body_decl_with_recovery to all body-decl keywords; BoundedCommand for VM runner
29. ✅ LAB-COMPILER-LIVENESS-P6: body-declaration recovery generalisation (2026-06-09)
    Audit finding: name_token()/expect_type() ALWAYS advance unconditionally — even on error
    Migration: 11 .ok() arms → parse_body_decl_with_recovery (input, capability, effect, read, snapshot, escape, stream, fold_stream, invariant, lead, max_steps)
    Deferred to P7: window/loop/for — have inner {} blocks; skip_until_body_boundary stops at inner }, not contract }
    decreases arm: always returns Ok — .ok() is semantic no-op; documented and left unchanged
    Token-progress guarantee: all 19 arms either recover, always succeed, or fall to _ => advance
    Fixture discovery: use IntLit (42) after keywords to get independent failures without consuming next keyword
    verify_liveness_p6.rb: 54/54 PASS; verify_liveness_p5.rb: 46/46 PASS (backward compat)
    No new OOF codes; no language semantics change; no canon impact
    Next P7: skip_to_matching_brace for window/loop/for; consider peek-before-advance for expect_type
30. ✅ LAB-TERM-T2-P2: OOF-R9 branch and multi-recur edge hardening (2026-06-08)
    Root cause: check_t2_callsite_in_expr IfExpr arm only walked cond, not then/else_block bodies
    Fix: extended IfExpr arm to mirror check_recur_in_expr exactly (stmts + return_expr for both branches)
    5 new fixtures: multi_recur_both_correct, multi_recur_one_wrong, if_both_branches_correct,
      if_wrong_else_branch, nested_arith_wrong
    Proven: mixed correct/wrong fails closed; correct site does NOT suppress wrong-site OOF-R9
    OOF-R3/R8 precedence unchanged; T1 syntactic_v0 unaffected; no new OOF codes; no canon changes
    verify_t2_oof_r9_edge_cases.rb: 21/21 PASS

    Finding 1: Named Record covers ~80% of near-term needs (JobReceipt, RackResponse, HttpRequest proven)
    Finding 2: Map[String,String] is the most urgent unproven gap — Rack headers deferred since P12
    Finding 3: JSON stays boundary format only; JsonValue deferred until concrete IO boundary use case proven
    Finding 4: Table/DataFrame → Stage 2 OLAPPoint (PROP-024); no Stage 1 mechanism

    Source: NET-P8/P9 + RACK-P14 + SIDEKIQ-P5 + RECORD-VM-P1/P2/P3 + PROP-043-P5

    Five confirmed reusable patterns (Category A):
      denial-as-data:       6-proof corpus (P6/P7/P8/P9/P14/P5) — strongest invariant; design law candidate
                            Every consumer handles capability denial as typed data; no exception/raise anywhere
      kind-discriminant:    HttpResult (3 values) + ContractResult (6 values); de facto lab convention
                            for typed unions; not yet syntax-supported (no sum types in grammar)
      budget-loop:          attempt+max_attempts in P8 RetryEnvelope + P5 RetryEnvelope + P5 JobReceipt
                            PROP-039 BudgetedLocalLoop confirmed as the right abstraction
      Map[String,String]:   PROP-043-P5 already production; headers (transport) + metadata (job) both use same shape
      three-layer:          HttpResult → ContractResult → consumer; appeared independently in P14 + P5

    Domain-local (stay classified):
      HttpResult:            NETWORK-LOCAL — 3-variant; `denied` HTTP-specific; transport internals
      ContractResult:        HTTP-DOMAIN-LOCAL — name too generic; 6-kind HTTP-bound; recommend future rename
      FullRackResponse:      RACK-LOCAL — integer HTTP status; Rack-only consumer
      JobReceipt:            SIDEKIQ-LOCAL — job_class/job_id Sidekiq-specific
      RetryEnvelope (P8/P5): INCOMPATIBLE SHAPES — P8 embeds HttpResult; P5 is re-enqueue instruction; don't unify

44b. ✅ PROP-045-P2: Source-level intent descriptor — parser + metadata propagation proof (2026-06-10)
    Category: lang / Track: source-intent-descriptor-parser-and-metadata-proof-v0
    Route: PARSER / METADATA PROPAGATION PROOF
    Depends on: PROP-045-P1, PROP-033/040 (profile_binding precedent)
    Production changes:
      parser.rb: `intent` keyword; module-level parse (after module, before imports);
        `parse_intent_decl` method; `parse_body_decl` dispatch arm; `ParsedProgram#to_h` intent_text fix
      classifier.rb: intent body node → no symbol; OOF-INTENT3 on duplicate; contract + module intent_text propagation
      typechecker.rb: contract + module intent_text pass-through
      semanticir_emitter.rb: intent_text in typed_contract_ir + typed_semantic_ir_program
    Key fix: `ParsedProgram#to_h` was missing `intent_text` — AST had the value; to_h did not emit it
    OOF-INTENT3: NOW ACTIVE — fires in classifier; first intent kept; fragment_class → oof
    Proved: intent_text present in contract_ir when declared; absent when not; orthogonal to profile_binding;
      no fragment_class change; no type_errors; no compute node injection; no capability authority
    53/53 PASS (8+8+6+8+6+6+5+6 across 8 sections)

    Category: governance / Track: query-v0-typed-intent-capability-mocked-execution-stabilization
    Route: GOVERNANCE / DESIGN STABILIZATION / NO NEW FEATURE WORK
    Decision: Query v0 is stabilized as typed query intent AST + StorageCapability gates +
      deterministic mocked execution + QueryResult / QueryExecutionReceipt + denial-as-data
      and query_error separation.
    Authority: lab evidence only; not canon authority, not public API, not real IO execution.
    Evidence base:
      LAB-QUERY-P1/P2/P3; LAB-STORAGE-CAPABILITY-P1/P2; LAB-EXECUTE-QUERY-P1/P2/P3;
      LAB-FILTER-EVAL-P1; LAB-QUERY-ORDER-LIMIT-P1; LAB-QUERY-MULTI-ORDER-P1;
      LAB-QUERY-PROJECTION-P1; LAB-TC-ARRAY-P1/P2; LAB-TC-NESTED-RECORD-CONTEXT-P1.
    Stable semantics:
      plan building is pure CORE; execution boundary is effect/capability-shaped;
      capability denial returns QueryResult{kind:"denied"}; malformed plan returns
      QueryResult{kind:"query_error"}; row_limit clamps and does not deny; projection
      happens after filter/order/limit; QueryExecutionReceipt records gates/result facts only.
    Closed surfaces:
      SQL execution, DB connection, ORM/ActiveRecord/Arel compatibility, persistence runtime,
      migrations, transactions, joins, aggregates, writes, query optimizer, StorageCapability
      live execution authority, production query runtime, public/stable API, canon change.
    Known v0 limits:
      mocked rows only; stringly Map[String,String] row values; no typed Row[T]; no joins;
      no aggregates; no writes; limited predicate language; no collation authority; no DB adapter.
    Boundary with IO:
      Query owns intent and receipts; IO owns adapter/substrate authority. Storage IO must not
      be silently equated with Network/File/Clock IO.
    Recommended next route:
      LAB-IO-BOUNDARY-P1 - IO family taxonomy and substrate readiness.
      Optional later: LAB-STORAGE-ADAPTER-P1; StorageCapability PROP only if governance
      decides grammar/public surface is needed.

      variant_type?(name), variant_arms(name), variant_arm_field_type(v,a,f), find_variant_for_arm(arm)
      infer_variant_construct — resolves variant by arm search; validates fields; returns type_ir(variant_name)

        exhaustiveness (covered_arms set vs declared_arms set); OOF-KIND1/2/3; result unification

34. ✅ PROP-043-P4: Map[K,V] production-edit planning (2026-06-09)
    Depends on: PROP-043-P3, PROP-043-P2, PROP-043-P1
    Scope: 2 files only — classifier.rb (1-line C1 fix at line 52: normalize_type → normalized_type_annotation)
        + typechecker.rb (~175 additive lines: MAP_STDLIB_FNS, infer_map_get/has_key/from_pairs/empty,
        infer_or_else, infer_array_literal, infer_record_literal, check_map_annotation, helpers,
        @output_type_hints pre-scan, OOF-MAP annotation scan, 2 infer_call arms, 2 infer_expr arms,
        1-line type_shapes C1 fix)
    SIR emitter: NO CHANGE — typed_ports + semantic_expr generic path already handle Map nodes
    parser.rb: NO CHANGE — Map annotations already parse; short names parse as call nodes
    P4-Q1..Q9 all resolved: insertion points exact; or_else confirmed absent (new addition);
        map_empty accepted as-is (C2, type_name equality only); from_pairs Unknown fallback silent;
        OOF-MAP wording templates locked; regression matrix defined (≥42 + T1/T2/T3 regressions)
    C1 fix: two-file (classifier.rb:52 + typechecker.rb:118) — normalized_type_annotation already exists
    C2 resolution: map_empty → Map[String,Unknown] passes type_name equality; context inference v1

## Workspace Repo Map

| Repo | Authority | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `igniter-lang` | Language canon: spec, proposals, grammar, compiler proof | Language meaning only |
| `igniter-lab` | Lab frontier: experiments, proofs, prototypes | Evidence only; not canon |
| `igniter-ruby` | Ruby Framework gem umbrella | Framework impl; not language spec |
| `igniter-org` | Public site (`igniter-lang.org`) | Projects current truth from lang/lab |
| `igniter-archive` | Recovery bucket from monorepo split | Not a default dependency |

**Monorepo note:** Workspace split from the `/igniter` monorepo. `igniter-archive` is the
quarantine bucket. Nothing there is a default dependency — review explicitly before pulling.

## Meta Notes

**MFN-001 (Portfolio Meta-Architect → Portfolio Architect Supervisor, 2026-06-07):**
- PROP-040 queued before PROP-039 → both now closed
- CR-001/002/003 firewall rules adopted in language-covenant.md
- Rack/Web/Ruby pressure stays lab-only (CR-001)
- PROP-039 accepted as vocabulary authority; parallel track confirmed; implementation closed

| LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P2 | view | CLOSED 56/56 | FileTreeRow definition JSON + render `{html,def_refs}` + oracle + diff-oracle interpreter; N→1 dedup, fail-closed unknown-op, dispatch seam proven |
| LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P3 | view | CLOSED 70/70 | Sidebar+FileTreeRow bundle; 2 definitions; N rows → 2 unique def_refs; slot values; per-instance state isolation; oracle+interpreter parity for both components |
| LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P4 | view | CLOSED 47/47 | Proof-local .igv→definition compiler; compiled hashes match hand-authored P3 hashes; content-addressable; 7 error categories fail-closed; compiled bundle compatible with P3 render/oracle/interpreter |

### LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P2 boundary
**Track:** lab-igv-tailmix-definition-render-diff-oracle-proof-v0  
**Result:** 56/56 PASS  
**Key findings:**
- Content-addressed `def_id = sha256:d9e2a8bb…` verified self-consistent by proof runner (DEF-08)
- `render → { html, def_refs }`: HTML carries only instance binding (`data-igv-def` + `data-igv-state`); no rules/ops inlined (RENDER-07/08)
- **N→1 dedup:** 3 instances → `unique def_refs == 1` (DEDUP-02)
- Oracle/interpreter parity: all triples match (INTERP-01–08)
- `dispatch` → host event; state unchanged (DISPATCH-03/06)
- Unknown op → `{ error: "unknown_op:<op>" }` immediately; no partial execution (FAILCLOSED-01–06)
- Definition: no VM/SIR/capability/eval (CLOSED-01–04)  
**Next route:** LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P3 (composition + slot values) or LAB-APP-STATE-P3/LAB-APP-ASSEMBLY-P1 on IDE pressure

### LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P3 boundary
**Track:** lab-igv-tailmix-nested-composition-bundle-dedup-slot-values-v0
**Result:** 70/70 PASS
**Key findings:**
- Bundle model: `{ bundle_id, component_map, definitions }` — 2 types → 2 definitions; `bundle_id = sha256(component_map)`; both def_ids self-consistent (BUNDLE-07/08)
- **N→2 dedup:** 3-row and 5-row renders both produce `def_refs.uniq.length == 2` (DEDUP2-01/02)
- Slot values (`items`, `title`) drive row count and binding data without mutating definitions (SLOTS-01/05)
- State isolation: `FTR.expanded` ⊥ `Sidebar.search_active` — disjoint keys, no cross-contamination (ISOLATE-01/05)
- Oracle/interpreter parity: all Sidebar + FTR triples match; interpreter (P2, unchanged) handles both types (INTERP2-01–08)
- Fail-closed: unknown op in nested component, missing component in bundle → error, no state/host_event leak (FAILCLOSED2-01–06)
- `.igv` sketch marked non-canon (IGV-03)
**Next route:** LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P4 (`.igv`→definition compiler, proof-local) or LAB-APP-STATE-P3/LAB-APP-ASSEMBLY-P1 on IDE pressure

### LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P4 boundary
**Track:** lab-igv-tailmix-igv-compiler-proof-v0
**Result:** 47/47 PASS
**Key findings:**
- `IgvCompiler.compile(source)` — pure Ruby proof-local parser; line-by-line recursive descent with indentation tracking; no external tools
- **Hash match:** compiled Sidebar `def_id == sha256:c59650b5…` and FTR `def_id == sha256:d9e2a8bb…` — byte-identical to hand-authored (COMPILE-04/05)
- **Content-addressability:** comments, blank lines, component-block order → same hashes; semantic change → different hash; cross-component isolation (ADDR-01–06)
- Compiled `bundle_id == sha256:63157b42…` — matches hand-authored; `bundle_id = sha256(component_map)` (BUNDLE-04/07)
- Compiled bundle is drop-in for P3 render/oracle/interpreter — all COMPAT results identical (COMPAT-01–10)
- 7 error categories raise `CompileError` with correct message: unknown op, duplicate component, child→missing component, instruction→undeclared state, invalid state default, malformed children block, missing component name (FC-01–14)
**Next route:** LAB-APP-STATE-P3 (G2 fact↔holder binding) or LAB-APP-ASSEMBLY-P1 (G3 event→op→fact for command palette) or LAB-IGV-TAILMIX-P5 (multi-event elements / payload routing)
